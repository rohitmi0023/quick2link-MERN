> # quick2link-MERN
MERN version of my quick2link project. 

It will essentially contain the links to my frequently used websites just like my quick2link-frontend-only
project. Besides this, I will add more & more features in it as I learn them. 
 
`next.txt` file will contain the topics that I will implement sooner to this repo.
 
  > # Usage
  
  * Create a `default.json` file in `config` folder
  * add your's `mongoURI` and `jwtSecret` in that file
  * Run `npm run dev` to start in development mode
